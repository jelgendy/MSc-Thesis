Code for MSc Thesis Project: Determining the Neutrino Mass using Supernova Bursts

Developed for use in snewpy, to be added to the codebase in order to apply the time of flight delay caused by the neutrino rest mass - see https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy

Still needs optimisation for efficiency and versatility

ArXiv link to be added here post-graduation
